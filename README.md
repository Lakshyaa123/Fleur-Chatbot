# Fleur-Chatbot
This project involves hosting the florist shop website on the cloud which integrates the chatbot. 

Initially, we create a chatbot using Amazon Lex and provide responses for possible queries. We define the intent for suitable utterances.

Next, we use Kommunicate to integrate the chatbot with the website we already built. It requires Access Key and Secret Access Key inorder to access the chatbot we have built in Amazon Lex. We can also enable the human entry feature which allows us to customise the chatbot responses whenever weâ€™re active.



Then, Kommunicate gives us a html integration code we can place in our website frontend. This successfully integrates the chatbot into the website.


This is how it appears after the setup a chatbot icon is present at the bottom,when clicked the automated message is sent from the chatbot.
